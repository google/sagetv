#### Notes about incrementing versions for developers:

* If you are the first to commit changes after a release, ensure that the following have been incremented beyond the last release:
    * MICRO_VERSION in sage/Version.java
* If you make any changes to stvs/SageTV7/SageTV7.xml, ensure that the following are updated in the STV:
    * AddGlobalContext( "STVversionText", "August 12, 2017" )
        * This should match the date of the commit.
    * AddGlobalContext( "ThisSTVSetVersionNum", "2017081201" )
        * This should match the date of the commit and if there was more than one commit the same day, the last two digits should be incremented.
        * The format is YYYYMMDDVV.
        * YYYY is the year.
        * MM if the month number.
        * DD is the day of the month.
        * VV is the commit version for this date. This resets to 01 if the date changes.
    * STVVersion [="9.1.7.0"]
        * This should start with MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.MICRO_VERSION in sage/Version.java
        * The last number should be incremented for each update of the STV for the MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.MICRO_VERSION SageTV release, starting with 0 for the first STV version of a new release.
