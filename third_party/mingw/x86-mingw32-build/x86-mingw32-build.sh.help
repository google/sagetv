PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION="
SYNOPSIS
   $USAGE

DESCRIPTION
   This script automates the process of building a MinGW cross compiler,
   which will run on the local host platform, generating code to be run
   on a Win32 host.

OPTIONS
   The following options may be specified, to fine tune the compiler
   build process; each may be abbreviated to its shortest unambiguous
   initial substring.

   --help      Display this mini-manpage, and exit.

   --version   Display the script version and the copyright notice,
               then exit.

   --batch, --unattended
               Use the build configuration choices as specified in the
               configuration file, without prompting for confirmation;
               the default is to interactively prompt for confirmation
               of configuration choices prior to building.

   --dry-run   Show the commands which would be executed to build the
               cross compiler, without actually building it; (may leave
               some side effects, such as working directory creation).

   --pre-clean, (--no-pre-clean)
               Clear, (do not clear), any existing files from the build
               directory, before commencing a new build; the default is
               clear the build directory.

   --post-clean, (--no-post-clean)
               Remove the build directory in its entirety, (leave the
               build directory as-is), on completion of the build; the
               default is to remove the build directory.

   --download, (--no-download)
               Download packages as required, (use only locally
               available packages), during the build.

   --use-latest-versions
               Substitute the latest version of any package which
               is locally available, if it appears to be more recent
               than the version specified in the configuration file.

PARAMETERS
   The first non-option argument, designated \`target-prefix', defines
   the prefix to be added to the name of each cross tool; the default
   is \`i386-mingw32', resulting in a set of tools which are invoked 
   as, e.g., \`i386-mingw32-gcc'.

ENVIRONMENT
   The following environment variables may be defined, and exported, to
   control the default behaviour of $script.

   XMINGW32_BUILD
      Set this to a space separated list of any of the OPTIONS defined
      above, to override the normal default settings.

FILES
   The $script package comprises a number of sub-scripts, each
   of which is named \`$script.*', and each should be considered
   to be an integral component of the primary script; only the following
   are of particular significance to the user:--

   $script.conf
      Specifies configuration options for building the cross compiler;
      may be modified, as required, to suit the user's preferences for
      build and installation options.

   $script.log
      Created during the build process, this provides a record of the
      configuration options specified for the most recent build.
