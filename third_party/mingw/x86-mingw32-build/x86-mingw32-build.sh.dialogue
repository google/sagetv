 This script will build and install a locally hosted cross-compiler for the
 $TARGET target.  This comprises the following components:--

    binutils    assembler, linker and library management tools; these
                must be built for the $TARGET target, and should be
                installed prior to building GCC itself.

    headers     the header files for the mingwrt and the w32api
                libraries; these too, are best installed before GCC
                is built.

    gcc         the GCC compiler itself, complete with all supported
                source language packages.

    w32api      the runtime libraries supporting the Win32 API.

    mingwrt
                additional libraries specific to the $TARGET target.

 For a first time installation, you should build all of the above.  On the
 other hand, if you are upgrading an existing installation, you may wish to
 select components individually, to reduce the build time.

 Currently, the standard MinGW compiler uses the setjmp/longjmp model
 for exception handling.  For compatibility, it is recommended that you
