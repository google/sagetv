---- Overview ----
------------------

This document details how to setup the build environment for
Sagetv Open Source, using Visual Studio 2015, for the purpose
of building Windows "native" (non-Java) code.  It assumes a Windows
computer with no previous installation of the tools listed below.

Installation requires a number of system reboots, so be prepared
and do not skip the reboots.

The process involves the following steps:

1. Install JDK
2. Install GitHub Desktop (optional)
3. Install DirectX SDK
4. Install Visual Studio 2015
5. Build SageTv Windows native code


=====================================================================
1. Install JDK
=====================================================================

Info:
  In deciding between installing the 32-bit vs. 64-bit
  version of JDK, consider that prior to SageOpenSource, SageTv
  was originally built using the 32-bit version of Java.
  To avoid unforseen issues it may be wise to start with a 32-bit 
  JDK installation for initial development.


Steps:
------
A) Download the Java Development Kit.

  Available here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

B) Install the Java Development Kit.
  Note the folder that it's installed to.

C) Create the following Environment Variable:
    SAGEDEVJDK

  It's value should be the path to where JDK was installed, i.e., 
  something like:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_60

  Do NOT quote the path, even though it may contain embedded spaces.


=====================================================================
2. Install GitHub Desktop
=====================================================================

Info:
-----
  GitHub Desktop is used to access the Sage source-code repository.

  Use of GitHub Desktop is optional.  It's also possible to download 
  source code via the web interface, at:
    https://github.com/google/sagetv

GitHub Desktop can be downloaded from:
  https://desktop.github.com/


=====================================================================
3. Install "DirectX SDK June 2010" edition
=====================================================================

Info:
-----
  "DirectX SDK June 2010" provides needed libraries to build Sage
  Microsoft has announced that this is it's final release.

Steps:
-----
A) Download Microsoft's "DirectX SDK June 2010" edition.
  It can be found at:
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812

B) Run the installer

--> At installation, choose to include "Direct X symbol files"
  (if this step is missed, re-run the installer again and
   check this option)


  The installer automatically adds DXSDK_DIR to the **System** 
  environment variables.  On a 64-bit OS, DXSDK_DIR points to:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)

C) Verify DXSDK_DIR env. variable is set (in System env. vars.)


=====================================================================
4. Install VS2015 (aka vs14)
=====================================================================
Visual Studio 2015 provides an IDE for working native code.  It also
included necessary libraries and compile tools.


A) Download from:
    https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs

B) Save the file (vs_community.exe)

C) Launch the downloaded file (runs the installer)

Visual Studio Community 2015 window opens:
  Accept the default installation location
    e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0
  
  "Choose the type of installation"
    select "Custom"

  Click "Next" button

  At the Select Features window, 
    Select the following features **in addition** to the defaults:
    Programming Languages
      Select "Visual C++"
        This automatically selects:
            Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015
            Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++  <<-- Must have y!!!
            Windows XP Support for C++

    Common Tools
      Select "Git for Windows"
      Select "GitHub Extension for Visual Studio"

  Click "Next" button
  Click "Install" button

  (the installer runs... can take almost an hour)

  Wait for "Setup Completed"

  Click "Restart Now" button

Note: You can re-run the installer again later to add or change
  the installation options.


=====================================================================
5. Build SageTv Windows native code
=====================================================================

We're finally ready to build Windows "native" (non-Java) code.

Prerequisites:
-----
  - JDK installed.
  - DirectX SDK, SDK6.1 & Visual Studio installed and configured
  - Environment variables set:
    DXSDK_DIR
    SAGEDEVJDK

Steps:
-----
A) Verify that the above environment variables have been set.
   Visual Studio needs them all to build the Solution.
   - Open a Command Prompt window.  
   - Type "set".  
   - Verify the variables listed above.

B) Use Git to get a local copy of the repository onto your computer.

C) After cloning the repository, use Windows Explorer to open
  up a window to your local copy where the sources are stored.

D) Locate the SageWorkspace.sln file.  It will be in:
    <your_local_GitHub_path>\sagetv\native

  Double-click on the SageWorkspace.sln file to launch Studio and
  load all the child Projects.

  The first time Studio is launched to access the Solution, you
  might encounter a series of questions about source control.
  Answer them.

E) Build the Solution:
  - On the Studio menu bar, ensure "Release" and "Win32" is chosen.
  - In the Solution Explorer sub-window, highlight SageWorkspace.
  - Right-click SageLauncher, select "Build"

  The resultant files will be in native\Build\Release & Debug


Common build failures:
-----------------------
* "RC1015: cannot open include file 'afxres.h' "
  Re-run the VS2015 installer and verify that MS Foundation Classes 
  were installed.

* "can't find jvm.lib"
  This occurs if SAGEDEVJDK is missing or incorrect

*  "fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'D3dX9.h' "
  This occurs if DXSDK_DIR is missing or incorrect
